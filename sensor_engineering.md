## 1. Introduction
Modern advanced engineering fields are driven by common aims of achieving high-performance, reduced power consumption and intelligent functionality. Advanced tech industries such as aerospace, automobile, biomedical and semiconductor industry require real-time precision measurements of parameters such as temperature, pressure and flow rate[1]. Therefore, sensor engineering has become a critical and challenging subfield in engineering, essential in the advancement of many other engineering disciplines. 
Semiconductor and biomedical industries are among the fastest growing engineering fields that leverage the latest technologies for groundbreaking innovations and implementations. Advancements in one industry such as semiconductors may set standards for other industries such as biomedical, automobile and data communication. Similarly, developments arising from fields such as material science may directly impact several other fields including semiconductor, biomedical and energy harvesting, highlighting the synergistic nature of the current technology and research advancements. Additional to academic contributions, industry leaders like ASML, Intel, and Medtronic play a pivotal role in setting benchmarks for current and next-level technology which can only be achieved through technological breakthroughs. Furthermore, the market economy is also a deciding factor on technology development and deployment[1].  
Sensor-based engineering tools play a vital role in semiconductor and electronic fields for process monitoring and quality assurance. Sensors in the medical field, known as ‘biosensors’ are transducers used for detecting biological elements which can help diagnosis or analysis in patient care. This paper explores state-of-the-art sensor technologies, including  design, simulation, and scalability, with emphasis on applications in the semiconductor and biomedical sectors. It also highlights key challenges, future directions, and the relevance of this interdisciplinary knowledge in advancing engineering careers.
The following sections of the paper, we delve into design principle of industrial sensors in semiconductor and biomedical fields, some sensor types that are used in industry which are compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductors(CMOS), microelectromechanical system(MEMS) based sensors, used materials for these sensors, industry level simulation and modeling tools, system encapsulation technologies, real-world challenges, future trends and career growth aspects, concluding with final remarks.

## 2. Design Principles of Industrial Sensors

Industry grade sensor designing requires adherence to several basic principles ensuring reliability and precision. In the biomedical industry, key priorities include, safety, miniaturization, low power consumption, and wireless functionality while simplifying signal processing and maximizing accuracy[1]. Furthermore, biocompatibility, biotoxicity, prolonged lifespan and reduced of side effects and improved precision of wearables or implantable devices are critical in translating from bench to clinic sensor development and therapeutic treatment innovation[2]. These principles serve in designing advanced sensors that can obtain critical information of the internal organs and tissues of the human body using non-invasive and wearable sensor technologies[3]. The challenge rests on mitigating noise and enhancing sensitive bio-signal acquisition through natural barriers like skin for wearable sensors, as well as in overcoming chemical and electrophysiological artefacts in implantable sensors[2].  Real-world example is Continuous Glucose Monitoring(CGM) wearable sensor and smart monitoring system by Medtronic[4].

In the semiconductor industry, the key objectives are refining power, performance and area(PPA)[5]. Significant importance is given to scalability, noise immunity, power efficiency as well as compatibility with existing fabrication technology while reducing the latency in time-to-market. It can be seen that the next generation technologies are consistently looking for the optimal performance of PPA, and there are tradeoffs between power and performance, size and accuracy, cost and implementability and sensor noise and sensitivity. Due to the complexity of the semiconductor fabrication, products may undergo hundreds of process steps with inspection and fault detection integrated throughout the process[6]. Measured parameters include critical dimensions, overlay accuracy, thin film thickness, and wafer defects[6] as shown in figure 1. Intel’s on-die Digital Thermal Sensors (DTS) for measuring instantaneous temperature and controlling platform heat is an instance of sensor engineering in semiconductor industry[7].  

The use of standard practices  and tools such as COMSOL, MATLAB, and TCAD are highly regarded in industry level sensor designing, simulation and technology innovations. These tools are assets to any engineer aiming to excel in the sensor engineering field and in their career. 
## 3. CMOS-Compatible Sensor Platforms

## 3.1. CMOS in the Semiconductor Industry:

CMOS is the backbone of most integrated circuit(IC) chips which includes n-type and p-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) for large scale microchip production with affordable price[8]. The attractive advantages of CMOS including high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), extremely large fan-out and temperature stability with considerable speed to power ratio proved their worth in microelectronics in the recent years. Several additional advantages and disadvantages of CMOS are listed in table 1. 

**Table 1:** Advantages and disadvantages of CMOS technology [3]  

| Advantages                                 | Disadvantages                                |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Use of both p- and n-type                  | Susceptible to static electricity             |
| Low power                                  | Slower than bipolar technology                |
| High speed to power ratio                  | Relative high mismatches in CMOS devices      |
| Same order of rise and fall transition times|                                               |
| High noise margin                          |                                               |

With increased attempts at creating Lab-on-chip (LoC) and Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, multi-application integration and packaging became necessary in semiconductor and electronics industry. Efficient integration between MEMS and CMOS can be achieved by utilizing silicon substrate beyond the typical use of printing integrating circuits(ICs),  such as in sensors, actuators and biochip designs[9]. One key challenge is maintaining the temperature for additional processing steps below 450 ℃ to  prevent damaging front end of the line(FEOL) devices[9].  Similarly, pressure, flow rate regulation and image-based quality assurance intended sensors are vital in process controlling in the semiconductor industry. 

One example of CMOS technology integration with the MEMS is a semiconductor metal oxide gas sensor(SMO) which has higher sensitivity, lower response time, low power consumption, lower fabrication cost, smaller footprint, and potential to miniaturize compared to other available gas sensors[9]. Temperature plays a significant role in SMO sensors, and hence, need to include an isolated microheater for better operation of the sensor. Commonly, this membrane fabrication is challenging and either full membrane which suspends the membrane, or a perforated membrane can be used to achieve it[9]. Fabrication of sensors with seamless integration with CMOS electronics in order to gain the aforementioned advantages drives many of the innovations in the industry. 

## 3.2. CMOS in the Biomedical Industry:

CMOS is highly valuable across other engineering fields as well, due to its high accuracy, high throughput and rapid measurement capabilities which are ideal in fields such as biomedical sensor engineering. Hence, CMOS is used in point-of-care(PoC) systems, LoC diagnostics and screening devices that include one or many of optical, magnetic, electrochemical and mechanical sensors[8]. These are used in variety of applications of biomarker or pathogen detecting micro- or nano- scale arrays for accurate detection of diseases[10], such an example is the SARS-CoV-2 virus detection with graphene-field-effect-transistor(FET) based biosensor that is illustrated in figure 2. 
In the optical sensor domain in the medical engineering field, CMOS image sensors(CIS) for disease diagnosis has depicted high sensitivity and specificity with low power dissipation and simple functionality proving it to be a cost-effective alternative to charge coupled devices(CCD)[8]. Some techniques provide label free techniques removing the major drawback in terms of time and cost for CIS. A smart-phone based imager was proposed with low background noise and good sensitivity with thin film interference filter, laser-diode based photo source and insert lenses with CMOS sensor chip to record magnified images into the mobile phone withing 2 hours  in [11]. Another optical sensor is described as a CMOS based portable test strip reader for Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori), which integrates Wi-Fi module to run on a smart tablet PC[12] as shown in figure 3(a).  Another optical sensor design was invented as a CMOS compatible quantitative polymerase chain reaction(qPCR) chip which can perform all required steps for qPCR including fluorescence detection, heating, controlling temperature, and navigating the fluid[13].  This chip utilized electrowetting on dielectric based droplet transport, micron scale polysilicon for heating, and Aluminum temperature sensors, while allowing an accuracy of 0.45 ℃ temperature regulation and transport volumes less than 1.2nano liters. (figure 3(b)). 
CMOS based electrochemical sensors are electrodes which are sensitive to characteristics such as dielectric constant, electrical charge, and conductivity and capable of converting them into electrical parameters such as current or voltage with low cost, in real-time, while utilizing label-free techniques and being portable. Most common type is the ion-selective field-effect-transistor (ISFET) based biological FET which are reported to use in detecting pH variation and bacteria DNA hybridization. Here, the poly-silicon gate voltage is modulated with the selective membrane sensitive to ions, enzymes or DNA and connected to the top metal and oxynitride passivation layer. ISFET can be fabricated with the standard CMOS fabrication process as shown in figure 4. However, they may require stable environment and large reference electrodes[8]. 
CMOS based magnetic sensors can detect magnetism due to magnetic particles attached to targeted particles with indirect contact as visualized in figure 5, providing high sensitivity compared to electrochemical sensors. They have the advantages of little to no background noise due to lack of magnetic properties in biological samples, ease of manufacturing and applicability to wide range of assays(magnetic beads from 50nm to 20um) [8]. The CMOS compatible Hall sensors are made up of n-type silicon to convert the magnetic field into voltage or current. The Lorentz force which deflects the semiconductor due to the current flowing orthogonal to the magnetic field, allowing electronic detection of magnetic property. Such CMOS based magnetic sensors are reported to be used for microfluidics in detecting E.coli in samples, detecting antigen and nucleic acid [8].  
While CMOS compatibility is important, sensor performance also relies on the material and the integration process, which is addressed in the next section.

## 4. Materials and Processes for MEMS 

## 4.1. Materials for MEMS in the Semiconductor Industry: 

Microelectromechanical system(MEMS) based sensors are used in multiple engineering fields including aerospace, petrochemical and automotive due to their ability in miniaturization, lightweight design, simplified signal processing mainly in advanced safety features such as collision avoidance systems in automotive industry[1]. Hence, silicon based high-temperature pressure sensors are well established in these industries.

 Silicon Carbide(SiC) is an emerging choice in high-temperature sensors due to wider band gap, higher carrier saturation drift rate, desirable mechanical properties such as high Young’s modulus, high thermal conductivity and high breakdown voltage inherent to third generation semiconductor materials [1].  The main obstacle in reaching high-temperature pressure sensors with gallium nitride(GaN) is the lattice and thermal mismatch between GaN and substrates such as SiC, Si or sapphire. Production of 12-inch all-SiC epitaxial wafers allowed commercial production of micro- and nano- scale MEMS sensor chips with reduced fabrication costs[1]. SiC epitaxial wafers are used in electric vehicle(EV), photovoltaic, smart grid, and aerospace applications while SiC-based GaN epitaxial wafers are used in radio frequency, 5G and radar applications[1]. Typically, epitaxy layer is grown over SiC wafer using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The layer of SiC can be affected by doping source and its concentration, reaction chamber temperature, pressure, and growth rate. Reducing defects in the epitaxial layer is the present day challenge in producing high-quality SiC-epitaxial wafers used in MEMS[1]. 

## 4.2. Materials for MEMS in Biomedical Devices: 

MEMS are also popular in developing low price, minimally invasive, diagnostics and clinical healthcare-related biosensor design. BioMEMS both wearable and implantable, are systems with sensors, actuators, microfluidics, wireless communication and signal processing units in a single biocompatible platform[3]. Most wearable BioMEMS are wristbands, patches, microneedle arrays, and smart textiles which gauge the heart rate, muscle activity, respiration, glucose level or movement using electrochemical, optical and mechanical methods of sensing[3]. Implantable BioMEMS are designed to provide reliable, long-lasting, power efficient sensing systems capable of independent functioning and remote monitoring. They are gaining popularity in healthcare, for example, in monitoring and regulating diabetes, epilepsy control, cancer treatment and cardiovascular monitoring[3]. 

	The advancement of BioMEMS lies in innovation of novel materials which are stretchable, biodegradable and behave as hydrogels made of nanocomposites and biocompatible materials. These materials have desirable properties of enhanced signal-to-noise ratio(SNR), dissolvable in biological environments with time and prevent triggering immune responses. Miniaturization and multimodal diagnostics in single MEMS devices also promote the progress of BioMEMS. Furthermore, coupling these devices with wireless and cloud-based devices and machine learning  also aids real-time monitoring, fast prediction and decision making as well as personalized healthcare[3].   

The choice of material for BioMEMS is rigorous as they must be flexible, biocompatible, stable in a biological environment, and yet integrable with existing electronic and mechanical systems. Several examples of such materials are as follows: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is a silicon-based synthetic polymer that exist in liquid, lubricant, rubber and resin forms, with outstanding chemical stability, optical transparency across broad wavelength range(240-1100nm), has minimal light scattering, minimal cytotoxicity and efficient oxygen scattering is suitable in chemically resistive applications, optical detections, and cell culture related applications of MEMS[3]. PDMS which is extreme stretchable with unique adhesion and selective bonding to certain substrates proving useful in microfabrication and patterning[3]. Some of the other synthetic polymers include Parylene C, Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), Polyurethane (PU), Polypyrrole (PPy) [3].

Furthermore, sustainability and biocompatibility urges usage of biodegradable polymers such as PolylacticAcid(PLA), in extensive applications including extrusion, injection molding and electrospinning[14], while natural polymers including Polysaccharides and proteins useful in spectroscopy, chemotherapy and other biological approaches. Meanwhile, emerging polymers like Polyphosphazenes(PPZs) and Sundew-Inspired-Adhesive-Hydrogels contain tunable properties such as hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, mechanical strength, degradability, and adhesiveness adapted from the nature[3].    

## 4.3. MEMS Fabrication techniques

	The choice of microfabrication requires a high yield, affordable, and less expensive to implement for mass production of 3D microstructure implementations. Main techniques used in the industry is photolithography, where light sensitive mask is subjected to UV light to develop the pattern based on the photoresist properties. Bulk micromachining, surface micromachining and LGIA techniques are major microfabrication techniques as summarized in figure 6[15].

	Bulk micromachining is a high-volume production process that shapes bulk materials by treating them with etchants. Mechanical structures can be obtained by isotropic or anisotropic etching of wafers of 250-500 μm thickness. It is used for shaping membranes, grooves, beams and holes for accelerometers, pressure sensors and flow sensors[15]. Based on the reactant bulk micromachining can be either dry or wet etching. Wet etching or chemical etching is a low-cost method of selective etching with liquid chemicals such as acids and bases. It is industrial method where control of fine-line patterning of critical dimensions is not stringent[15].  Dry etching or plasma etching has no wet reactant but gas phase for ion-assisted chemical vapor etching. It is a multi-step process based on plasma to obtain characteristics of MEMS, which is commonly used in IC manufacturing for its ability to precisely control critical dimensions[15]. However, it may damage the wafer material, distort the profile and even cause mask sputtering due to excess chemical or physical process. 

	Surface micromachining uses alternative deposition, patterning, etching of thin layers up to 2-20 μm and structures with tighter tolerances using physical or chemical vapor deposition techniques. Lithographic or etching methods are required in the subsequent step to shape the structures and high-temperature annealing to reduce stress between atomic layers[15]. It is used for MEMS sensors, actuators, motors, gears and micromirror assays, though integrating microstructures is challenging due to vulnerability.

	LGIA is an acronym for German terms that represents lithography, electrodeposition, and molding, and it is a multi-step fabrication process which uses deep X-ray lithography. The process involves masking, illuminating the photoresist with deep X-ray lithography to get the mold of desired pattern, developing pattern using electrodeposition and removing the photoresist mask. This process demands full comprehension of material properties and surface to obtain MEMS with desired properties and functionalities. It is an industry level high-volume fabrication process for MEMS such as microchannels, micro-optics and X-ray micro-lenses down to less than 50nm average roughness [15]. Though the process is desirable, require extra effort to manage multiple steps, the exposure may harmful to the user, and need high cost for initial equipment such as extreme ultra violet lithography (EUV) by ASML[16].   
 
## 5. Simulation and Modeling Techniques

The design and fabrication process of MEMS sensors affect their performance. The initial parameters of the sensors are calculated with their respective underlying principles. Then, simulation tools are used to model the design, and tested for various pressure, temperature, flow rate or any other variables to observe its behavior and keep optimizing to reach desired performance or a favorable tradeoff. Some of such simulation and modeling tools are described below. 

## 5.1.	COMSOL Multiphysics

COMSOL Multiphysics® is a finite element analysis simulation tool that can couple multiple physics such as electromagnetics, structural mechanics, acoustics, fluid flow, heat transfer, particle behavior and chemical reactions. It provides insights of a model or design which is useful for industrial design and manufacturing as well as for testing labs and research facilities[17].  For example, design optimization based on geometry carried out for MEMS based gas sensor allowed coupling electrical, thermal and mechanical physics in identifying the dimensions of the micro hot plate to achieve temperature uniformity by evaluating temperature, displacement, and power consumption of each design using COMSOL[18].

 Moreover, biosensor simulation of microfluidic devices, implantable systems and drug delivery methods with COMSOL is used to verify theories that are derived to explain the sensor behavior [19]. One such example is the simulation of MEMS based flexible flow sensors which can be attached to a catheter tip to measure in situ blood flow rate[19].  COMSOL allowed sensor optimization with substrate material, length of sensor inside the blood vessel, by visualizing flow rate, pressure and temperature of blood with shell model approximation for thin nichrome heater film wrapped around the catheter surface (figure 7)[19]. 

## 5.2.	TCAD 

Technology computer-aided design(TCAD) combines semiconductor physics and power of high-performance computing in delivering guidelines for process and device development[20]. In the semiconductor industry, TCAD is applied in process or device simulation, and circuit simulation to optimize manufacturing processes with adequate levels of precision and complexity. TCAD is a tool highly regarded in both industry and academia for its ability to model device physics and aid in shortening the development cycle and reducing the fabrication cost. In TCAD device simulations, the behavior of device (i.e., V-I characteristics and frequency response) is calculated based on the device geometry, material, electrode connections, doping and other parameters such as stress profile. 

There are of two types of TCAD solvers: which are transport equations coupled with electrostatic solver and Maxwell’s (Poisson) equation solver for quasi-static electric fields[20]. Typical TCAD technology may vary according to the level of precision and complexity. Figure 8 is a summary of industry as well as academic state-of-the-art TCAD summarized by Synopsys Inc. It is important to note the significance of  current TCAD engineering approaching the top level which has atomic level TCAD, moving upwards from the bottom level, as the modern transistor dimensions are rapidly approaching atomic level. Beyond the classical level of TCAD, in the quantum range, nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF), density functional theory (DFT), and drift-diffusion (DD) are incorporated into multi-scale TCAD Framework. The most accurate but computationally expensive model is DFT-NEGF suitable for path-finding research of emerging technologies as it used as an approach to model nonequilibrium quantum transport in atomic nanostructures. In practice, calibrated DD model can still provide satisfactory accuracy up to sub 10nm node and also well received by the industry[20]. DD-TCAD used by intel is illustrated in figure 9. Synopsys Sentaurus is one of the widely used industry based TCAD tool for advanced CMOS, FinFET, power devices and sensors.

## 5.3.	SPICE

SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) tools are key in simulating analog or digital circuits prior to any fabrication process to verify the performance, functionality and eventually shorten the time-to-market. SPICE simulations provide validation on the design, allows parameter optimization and monitoring device level noise, parasitic capacitance, leakage and other non-linear behaviors[21].  A collection of SPICE tools widely used in industry are summarized in the following table. CMOS switching delay signal modeling is a practical application of SPICE tools. 

**Table 2:** Comparison of popular SPICE tools [21–27]  

| SPICE Tool | Developer               | Availability | Use |

| Xyce [27]    | Sandia National Labs   | Free         | Parallel SPICE simulator for large scale simulations |

## 5.4.	MATLAB

MATLAB® or MATrix LABoratory is a programming language as well as a numerical computing environment specialized in matrix manipulation and data visualization, algorithm and interactive user interface designing to communicate with programs that operate in other programing languages. Additional toolboxes such as signal processing, bioinformatics, image processing, data acquisition, and deep learning toolboxes and packages such as Simulink provide multi-domain simulations for design and debugging of systems as well as data and signal processing frameworks. It can be regarded as a benchmark tool in signal processing in biomedical field with ability to process large matrix of data based on inbuilt algorithms as well as user defined algorithms [28]. Signal preprocessing, feature extraction  of biological signals obtained by wrist using wearable sensors as in [29] and using large matrix manipulation and machine learning power for classification for diabetes diagnosis as in [30] are examples of wide range of applications with MATLAB. 

## 5.5.	Python

Python is one of the most versatile programming languages which is highly regarded in both biomedical and semiconductor industry. It has a large library of packages suitable for a variety of biosensor applications such as signal processing, visualization, medical image analysis, machine learning and communication with external devices for prototyping. Furthermore, python comes handy in automation, device simulation and post-processing, data analysis as well as in machine learning approaches for optimization[31]. Brain computer interfacing with python shows the application capabilities and user friendliness of python[32]. 

## 5.6.	LabVIEW

LabVIEW(Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) by National Instruments is a graphical programming tool that is widely used in the biomedical and semiconductor industries in instrument user interfaces, data acquisition, automation[33] and real time processing of data. Standalone programming capability as well as linking with programming languages as MATLAB, Python and other cloud computing methods makes LabVIEW a highly regarded skill in the field of semiconductor as well as medical instrumentation[34]. 
Once simulation validates structural and electrical performance, the next stage is ensuring sensor survivability and performance through effective encapsulation. 

## 6.	Packaging and Encapsulation

## 6.1.	Packaging in semiconductor Industry:

Encapsulation involves connecting the MEMS sensors and other IC parts electrically. The common method of connecting sensors to the electronic chips that perform necessary data processing is wire bonding which uses metal leads to connecting electrical interconnections. Wire bonding typically includes ball bonding using gold wire under high pressure and temperature requiring high surface cleanliness. Thermoultrasonic ball bonding and ultrasonic wedge bonding use a solid-welding method to weld the ball head to the meal layer of the chip substrate. Gold is the standard metal for bonding between chips due to excellent electrical conductivity and high meting point. Still gold may experience failure due to eutectic grain growth at Au-Si interface, which causes long-term reliability issues[1]. Platinum, Copper, and specially treated Aluminum are other choices for encapsulation due to high temperature, high pressure tolerance and high electrical conductivity. 

Apart from these methods, leaded packaging is a well-established method of encapsulating sensor and chip components on wafers, yet it falls short under demanding environments such as high temperatures. The leadless packaging such as flip-chip packaging (figure 10) uses an underfill for thermal stress distribution with solder bumps to establish electrical connection and mechanical support. Through-silicon via(TSV) is a widely used method for 3D integration of MEMS packaging[1] due to lower delay, lower cost, and better performance.


## 6.2.	Packaging in biomedical industry

Unlike semiconductor packaging, BioMEMS require techniques that minimize thermal and chemical stress while ensuring biocompatibility and fluid resistance. The final sensor product needs to be in contact with biological environment such as a wearable or functioning as a single system with the biological environment as an implantable device. Hence, biocompatibility is one major consideration for encapsulation. Typical bonding techniques used for MEMS with high temperature can damage the properties or the sensitivity of the BioMEMS. Thus, for polymer-based BioMEMS, low-temperature bonding processes without excessive voltage, high-pressure or vacuum environments are preferred.

 Ultrasonic welding and microwave assisted  joining is for localized melting of metallic or conductive polymer layers. In contrast, UV-induced photodegradation of substrates such as PMMA at reduce temperature enables preserving the dimensions and micro features[35].  Another bonding technique uses intermediate material to bond layers of BioMEMS which are compatible with wide ranges, low temperatures and cleanroom environments. Ultra-thin layer of adhesives such as UV curable material patterned with screen printing or lithography, are also being used.  Another method is lamination, where a thin adhesive layer on the lamination is heated and pressed onto the MEMS structure[35], and Riston dry resist film is such a standard lamination method. Foil bonding uses Teflon heated up to 120 ℃ mainly in fluidic BioMEMS[35]. 


## 7.	Real-World Challenges & Industry Adoption

Due to the fast-evolving nature of the semiconductor industry, it is vital that the latest technical node is in compliance with the rest of the design features such as the packaging and housing, across different manufacturers. Hence, the designs are usually made following standards set by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council(JEDEC)[36]. The provision of part numbers for different components, terms, definitions, symbols and standards allows interoperability among electronic fields and previous tech nodes, saves fabrication cost as well as maintaining uniformity in technical requirements. By adhering to JEDEC, it is possible to reuse validated design IP blocks, streamline cross-vendor fabrication, and ensure long-term product maintainability. 

Unlike biomedical innovation which can be fragmented, semiconductor industry benefits from unified scaling and platform design. Emerging technologies like High-NA-EUV[37] is required of  advanced technological cross-collaborations to reach atomic level precision to reach the sub-2 nm node to ensure future miniaturization. 

On the other hand, medical industry innovations, though advanced in research level, must go through rigorous safety and efficacy evaluations to reach patient care, irrespective of any cost benefit. These regulatory measure may vary based on country or region, and due to lack of universal benchmark standards, many advanced designs face hindrance in  scaling up and in clinical acceptance [3].  Typically, the approval process is extensive for BioMEMS requiring greater attention in clinical testing, and longer time to produce commercially. Furthermore, upcoming technologies such as organ-on-chip may not have sufficient guidelines established, delaying the optimal time-to-market for such BioMEMS [3].   Regulatory authorities such as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) are the key stakeholders between clinical innovation and the commercialization of such BioMEMS [3].

Prior to transferring sensor systems from bench-to-clinic, standardization evaluations need to be carried out. Tensile properties of tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation at break tested according to ASTM D412 set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials, while ASTM D882 is used for testing sensors made of plastic sheets and ASTM D4482 for fatigue life, hysteresis, and cyclic deformation of rubber materials. ISO 14708-1 is a standard that has specific testing standards for implantable devices under vibration, mechanical impact, temperature changes and subjected to humidity. Biocompatibility test standard of ISO 10993 has a series of toxicity tests required for devices before clinical deployment[2]. Electrical compliance to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 60601) and Electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are also required based on the device application. Adhering to these standards guarantees the desired behavior of the sensors and user safety.

User satisfaction, privacy and data protection are key when deploying semiconductor chips as well as BioMEMS such as wearable or implantable devices. It is expected to be lightweight, flexible, with user-friendly features and customizability for greater acceptance among the society while protecting privacy data while sharing and collecting user information via cloud-based methods[3].   Protocols such as I2C, SPI are essential for chip-to-chip communications, while BLE and MQTT are key for wearable and implantable devices for wireless communications. AES and TLS are used as encryption protocols, while authentication standards like OAuth2, and regulatory standards such as IEC 80001 are implemented to ensure safety and security of data communication. 

## 8.	Future Directions & Career-Relevant Trends

The semiconductor industry has become a multi-billion-dollar industry with complex, highly precise and carefully controlled processes, requiring monitoring and fault-detection in every step to prevent mistakes and failures in the high-volume productions. Fault detection classification systems (FDC) is one such measure to inspect wafer quality[6]. The industry aims to use machine learning models to process the multi-sensor time series data to streamline and make the defect and fault detection more efficient[6], stepping towards smart fabs.  Furthermore, instead of traditional monolithic SoCs, the industry is moving towards multi-die and chiplet based models which are more scalable, efficient and cost-effective[38].  One such example is the Intel presenting Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express(UCIe) standard for computing blocks inside a chip as a connector for high-bandwidth and low-latency connector[39]. 

The future of BioMEMS is promising with innovation and interdisciplinary collaborations, especially with machine learning, and IoT for remote, real-time patient care and personalized healthcare when integrated with wearable and implantable MEMS sensor devices. Multifunctional BioMEMS promoting LoC concept for sensing, drug delivery, and therapeutic interventions can drastically reduce the diagnosis and treatment times[3]. Providing personalized healthcare structured to one’s genetics, or metabolic data can be achieved in the near future with LoC and IoT technologies[3].  Impactful point-of-care diagnostics can be expected with affordable and accurate devices with BioMEMS. While targeting accuracy and high performance, it is also prioritized to invent power efficient BioMEMS similar to semiconductors and other electronic industries. Harnessing green energy from the human body to power the BioMEMS, nanogenerators, and self-powered technologies are sustainable future expansion directions for BioMEMS[3]. Taking a step further, regenerative medicine and tissue engineering can be expected to have 3D organs and tissue culturing that can seamlessly integrate with BioMEMS promising great potential in prosthetics and synthetic organs[3]. It is prudent to say that leaps of advancements can be expected in near future due to high-tech initiatives like Neuralink which already have started their brain computer interfacing(BCI) with successful clinical trials[40].  
	
Based on the existing technologies and future trends it is expected to see synergy between engineering disciplines with other fields such as material science and physics. Hence, knowledge and firsthand experience in these converging fields may benefit the engineering graduates planning to step into the semiconductor industry as well as biomedical engineering. It is also possible to see emerging engineering sub-fields such as sensor engineering due to the vast applications and importance in sensor applications in the industry. Sensor-based R&D, packaging  integration, and medical device prototyping engineering are some such roles of growth potential in the industry. It is vital the emerging engineers are exposed to the tools and standards of the industry, additional to their theoretical knowledge for seamless integration into the industry. Practice and exposure can be received with free and opensource tools and online certifications before stepping in to such career.
