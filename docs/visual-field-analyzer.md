# Visual Field Analyzer â€“ Calibration and Optics

I worked on both old and new generations of the **Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA)** including HFA2 and HFA3 840/860.

## Device Features:

- Vision lens matching based on patient prescription
- Focus LED fixation
- Liquid-filled lenses in HFA 860
- Measures retinal sensitivity for glaucoma, cataract diagnosis

## Technical Touchpoints:

- Glass, color, and aperture wedges for light modulation
- Light intensity logged in dB
- Calibrated lens movement and button response accuracy

> These devices combine **optics, sensor feedback, and user interface design**, giving me cross-functional skills in device calibration and patient-friendly engineering.
