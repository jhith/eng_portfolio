# MRI and CT System Servicing – High-Tech Diagnostic Platforms

I assisted in troubleshooting MRI systems (e.g., **Scyra MRI** at NHSL) and CT systems using Siemens **CareDose 4D**.

## MRI Work:

- Identified hose leaks in chiller loop
- Serviced filter panels and verified Faraday cage shielding
- Verified optical cable transmission for imaging data

## CT Diagnostics:

- Used **dummy plug** in place of the tube for safety testing
- Reviewed radiation safety and dosimetry functions
- Diagnosed tube current and cooling issues

> These systems involve RF shielding, liquid cooling, optical signaling, and high-voltage circuits—merging multiple engineering disciplines under patient safety protocols.
