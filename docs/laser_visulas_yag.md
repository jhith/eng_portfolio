# VISULAS YAG III – Carl Zeiss

## Overview
The VISULAS YAG III is an ophthalmic laser system used to make non-contact incisions in ocular tissue via photodisruption.

- **Laser Types**: 
  - Nd:YAG (1064 nm)
  - Optional 532 nm Green Laser for photocoagulation
- **Applications**:
  - YAG: Posterior Iridotomy, Posterior Capsulotomy
  - Green Laser: Diabetic retinopathy, retinal tears, retinal vein occlusion

## Technical Notes:

- **Optical breakdown threshold**: ~2.5 mJ in air
- **Pulse timing**: ~4 ns
- **Components Serviced**:
  - Aiming beam module
  - Power measuring circuit
  - Slit lamp alignment
- **Safety Systems**: Ensured beam path alignment, tested optical elements, and verified energy attenuation controls.

## Working Principle
The system uses a four-level laser configuration:
- **Pump Source**: Flash tube or laser diodes
- **Active Medium**: Neodymium-doped YAG crystal
- **Optical Resonator**: Fully and partially reflecting mirrors
- **Output**: Focused laser beam generates plasma (photodisruption)

## Safety Note
- **Class 4 Laser**: Hazardous; wavelength is invisible and bypasses blink reflex
- **Protective Measures**: Includes ocular shielding and interlock mechanisms

## Site Visit – Kalubowila Hospital
- Observed live operation of VISULAS YAG III
- Examined display interface, laser path alignment, calibration procedures

# Nd:YAG Laser System – Biomedical Service Insights

During my internship at DIMO Healthcare Pvt Ltd, I gained direct experience servicing Nd:YAG laser systems, particularly the **VISULAS YAG III** used in ophthalmic procedures.

> This hands-on work deepened my understanding of laser physics, energy delivery in clinical settings, and precision calibration under safety constraints.
