# Cath Lab & LINAC Systems – Power and Beam Diagnostics

I gained experience working with Varian  **LINACs**, and advanced cancer treatment device during field visits and calibrations at cancer hospital in Maharagama, Colombo.

## LINAC Servicing:

- Systems include:
  - Waveguide with SF₆ gas
  - Pulse Forming Network (PFN)
  - Thyratron switches for high-voltage pulses
- Maintenance Highlights:
  - High-voltage contact cleaning
  - Collimator plate lubrication and alignment
  - Carousel filter diagnostics and self-calibration modes
  - Error handling for STPS, MLC, and beam alignment

## Safety & Circuit Experience:

- Diagnosed circuit boards with ±5V, ±12V, 15V, 27V supplies
- Relay rewiring for old boards
- Verified inverse intensity filters and patient protection wedges

> This experience taught me the core of **pulse power electronics**, **beam diagnostics**, and **precision electronics servicing** in a critical care environment.
