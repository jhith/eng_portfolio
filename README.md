This portfolio contains selected technical projects I completed during graduate studies. 

This page demonstrates the LabVIEW vi I programmed for controlling the Tektronix signal generator to stimulate a sample of interest and acquire the responses, from the sample , display real time and save csv data for post processing. The responses were observed with signal analyzer SR780, and the FFT data were communicated using GPIB cable in to the PC to be displayed and recorded using the vi.
