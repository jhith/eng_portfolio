# Gamma Camera Maintenance â€“ Nuclear Imaging Systems

At Lanka Hospital and other facilities, I assisted in the maintenance of gamma imaging systems.

## Key Components:

- **Collimators**: Manual replacement
- **Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs)**: 59-unit array servicing
- **Collision Detector**: Troubleshooting and calibration

## Actions Taken:

- Replaced collimator and adjusted alignment
- Cleaned sensor connections and checked shielding
- Worked with safety protocols involving radioactive sources

> This work improved my understanding of nuclear imaging safety, sensor arrays, and how analog signal amplification happens through photomultipliers.
