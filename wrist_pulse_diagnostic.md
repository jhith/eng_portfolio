Wrist pulse‚Äìbased diagnostic systems aim to detect diseases **non-invasively** by recording and analyzing the mechanical patterns of wrist pulse signals. This project was inspired by diagnostic principles from **Ayurvedic** and **Traditional Chinese Medicine**, where **pulse palpation** is a key tool in assessing internal health.

## System Overview

The system uses **doctor-wearable piezoelectric sensors** that gently rest on the wrist. These analog pulse signals are passed through **basic amplifier and filter circuits** to reduce noise, then digitized using **LabVIEW VIs** and a **DAQ (Data Acquisition) card**.

## Signal Properties and Collection Method

Wrist pulse signals typically lie in the **1‚Äì2 Hz** range [1]. Our design included:

- **Low-pass filtering** to eliminate high-frequency artifacts (e.g., power-line noise)  
- **Analog amplification** to boost low-amplitude biological signals  

Inspired by traditional diagnostic methodology, **three sensors** were placed simultaneously across the wrist to record signals from different arterial points‚Äîoffering a richer dataset for pattern recognition.

### Key Characteristics of Wrist Pulse Signals:

- Low in amplitude  
- Periodic but variable in shape and timing  
- Highly sensitive to motion and sensor placement

## Signal Processing with MATLAB

Once collected, the raw data was analyzed using MATLAB. The key steps included:

- **Baseline wander removal** (to compensate for breathing-induced drift)  
- **Pulse cycle segmentation**  
- **Time- and frequency-domain feature extraction**  
  - Pulse duration, peak amplitude, power spectral density, etc.  
- **Pattern-based classification** for disease mapping

## ‚öôChallenges Faced

Building the system presented real-world technical challenges:

- **Motion artifacts** from hand movement or breathing required careful detrending and signal conditioning.
- **Sensor-hand interaction** was unpredictable. A **dampening layer** helped reduce unintended pressure spikes.
- **Electrical noise** was mitigated using **shielded coaxial cables**, lowering parasitic capacitance and improving signal quality.

##  What I Learned

This project taught me several lessons in biomedical signal design and embedded system integration:

### üîπ Good signal acquisition is the foundation
You can‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù a poorly captured signal with filters. Clean capture at the source always outperforms aggressive post-processing.

### üîπ Feature extraction enables meaningful diagnostics
The quality of interpretation depends entirely on the **features**‚Äîlike waveform shape, pulse rate variability, or spectral response.

### üîπ Traditional knowledge can guide modern design
Mapping sensors to Ayurvedic pulse zones added cultural relevance *and* provided valuable diversity in signal morphology.


## Closing Thoughts

Working on this system deepened my understanding of **sensor-hardware interaction**, **real-time noise mitigation**, and the **complexity of biological signals**. More importantly, it showed me how ancient diagnostic wisdom can inspire modern engineering innovations in wearable and non-invasive medical systems.
