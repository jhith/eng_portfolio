# Fluoroscopy and Digital X-Ray Systems â€“ Field Servicing Experience

Working with **Siemens Luminos Agile Max** and **Artis Zee systems**,
I assisted in quarterly servicing and issue resolution of fluoroscopy and digital X-ray systems in major hospitals in Colombo.

## System Components:

- **X-ray Generator**
- **Flat Panel Detectors (wired & wireless)**
- **FLC OS (FluoroSpot Compact)**
- **Cassette-based detection for analog imaging**
- **CU filters and collimators**

## Tasks Performed:

- Checked mechanical movements of filters and collimators
- Cleaned contact points using sandpaper and contact cleaner
- Serviced high-voltage supply and cooling subsystems
- Verified dehumidifier and power unit operation
- Troubleshot imaging issues in free X-ray and table X-ray configurations

## Technical Highlights:

- Wi-Fi and wired detector integration
- Protocol checklist-based preventive maintenance
- High-voltage cleaning to avoid arcing in collimators
- Patient safety: ensured failsafe interlocks for dose control and beam shaping

> Exposure to these systems allowed me to bridge imaging physics and power electronics with patient-centric reliability engineering.
